# Training: DOM Events & jQuery

In this training, you'll practice with some of the most common DOM events in jQuery:

- ready
- change
- click

The `.ready` method is specific to jQuery and uses a few native JavaScript event types internally. The other events listed are all native JavaScript events, and we recommend you use them with jQuery's `.on`.

You can find a full list of `event`-related methods in [jQuery's event documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/). For a list of standard JavaScript events, check [MDN's event reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

## Instructions:

Fork this repository to your GitHub account, then clone your GitHub copy onto your computer.

* Each event has its own directory with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  Start each event page by opening its HTML file in your browser.  
* Read the descriptions below (and the existing HTML and JavaScript) for each event page. To meet the goals, you'll need to change each `base.js` file. Do not change the HTML files.  
* Make sure to keep your developer console open so that you can check for bugs!  
* Make at least one git commit for each page.  

### `ready`

**Get the page to say "Go!" without touching the html.**

**Addition! Get the total to update whenever you update the numbers.**

Stretch: Add a "reset" button that clears all the inputs.

### `click`


**Create a list of all the phrases that are clicked.**

Stretch: In addition to listing the phrase I clicked, can you include a timestamp?

###Wrap it Up

Recommended: Can you link all the pages together? Create a `<nav>` element on every page, with links to all the other pages.
